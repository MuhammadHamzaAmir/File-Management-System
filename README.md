# File-Management-System
- Through object-oriented programming in python, we have implemented data structure in the form of singly linked lists. 
- All functions related to file handling and file management will alter the data structure respectively.
-  We have created a terminal based GUI in which we will provide options to the user regarding the file handling or file management operations they want to use. 
- Currently, we have implemented 12 functions.
- After selecting the operation they want to use, the user will provide the desired inputs and action will be performed on the targeted files in the directories. 
- User must be careful while selecting the mode in which he/she is opening the file. For instance, if he/she tries to write in a file in read mode, it will give an error and vice versa.
- While users can mainly interact with file handling operations on the front end, all actions performed on data structures are mainly done on the backend and are not visible to the user.
